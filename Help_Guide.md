# Automatic Revision Control Help Guide

**The following steps apply to new files that have never been uploaded in the system.**

   1. Navigate to the Files tab and select the project on which you want to upload a new file. You will see a list of   folders on the left side of the screen under the project you have selected. 

   2. Select the Files to open the folder. 

   3. Upload a file, you will now see the upload screen, the Rev option will now say Auto and you will not be required any        more to enter any digit. Fill out the rest of the attributes and click “Upload”.

   8. To summarize, the revision will only increase when a new file is uploaded by a user. The version will work the same as in the past. If another file were to be uploaded, it will continue to automatically increment the revision by 1.



**The following steps only apply if a file is already in the system before the new automatic revision control was added to your project.**

   1. Navigate to the Files tab and select the project on which you want to upload a new file. You will see a list of folders on the left side of the screen under the project you have selected.

   2. Select the Files to open the folder.  

   3. For the file below, the revision is 2, this revision was chosen by the user before the automatic revision was implemented. 

   4. If you upload a new file for this file, the file screen will have the Rev option as Auto   nd will no longer require you to enter any digit. 
 
   5. Once the file is uploaded, the revision will automatically increment from the previous revision. Since the revision was previously 2 the new revision for the file will now be 03.

  6. Once the file has finished the file workflow, the Revision will remain as 03.
 
  7. To summarize, the revision will only increase when a new file is uploaded by a user. The version will work the same as in the past. If another file were to be uploaded, it will continue to automatically increment the revision by 1.
