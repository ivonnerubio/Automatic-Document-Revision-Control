Automatic Revision Control Help Guide
Future Files
The following steps apply to new files that have never been uploaded in the system.
In Asite, navigate to the Files tab and select the project on which you want to upload a new file. You will see a list of folders on the left side of the screen under the project you have selected. 


Select the Files to open the folder. 

Upload a file, you will now see the upload screen, the Rev option will now say Auto and you will not be required any more to enter any digit. Fill out the rest of the attributes and click “Upload”.
 
Once the file is uploaded, the revision will start at 00 since this is a new file
 
Once the file has finished the file workflow, the revision will remain as 00.
 

If the file is uploaded again, the upload screen will have the same revision of Auto.  


Once the file is uploaded the Revision will be 01.
       

To summarize, the revision will only increase when a new file is uploaded by a user. The version will work the same as in the past. If another file were to be uploaded, it will continue to automatically increment the revision by 1.
